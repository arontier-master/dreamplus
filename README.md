How to use facilities on DreamPlus Gangnam

## ID cards

### For residents

You can ask the Arontier representative (not DreamPlus staff) in DreamPlus Gangnam to issue a resident's mobile ID.
If there is a seat available, he/she can send an invitation for the mobile ID. It could take up to 24 hours to issue a new ID.

You will receive two emails sequentially:
* to set your password for your account (link valid only for 60 minutes),
* to import mobile ID to your smart device (link valid only for 24 hours).

To import mobile ID, you need to install the following app on your mobile device: 
* iPhone: https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%EC%97%90%EC%96%B4%ED%8C%9D/id1469006723
* Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supremainc.android.mc

You can use mobile ID card on the main entrance and the floor entrance. To access Arontier offices,
you need to know a keypad passcode for each office.

### For visitors

You can request a visitor's pass (physical plastic card) at the front desk in the lobby. In the company name field type "아론티어" and in the personnel field, type the Arontier employee name you are visiting. 

Once you get the visitor's pass, you can use it on the main entrance and the 2nd floor entrance.
And as long as in DreamPlus Gangnam, you must be accompanied by your visiting Arontier employee.  

Don't forget to return the visitor's pass to the front desk in the lobby.
